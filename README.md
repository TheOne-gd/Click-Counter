Click counter version 1.0.0
A Click Counter web page is a simple application that tracks and displays the number of times a user clicks a button. It typically includes:
- A button: The main interactive element that users click to increase the counter.
- A display area: Shows the current count, updating dynamically as the user clicks.
- JavaScript logic: Manages the click event and updates the count in real time.
- Styling (CSS): Provides a user-friendly design to make the page visually appealing.
More advanced versions might include features like reset functionality, local storage to save the count, or even analytics tracking.
